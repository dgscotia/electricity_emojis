This simple project translates shares of electricity generation into emojis.

It's based on an idea from [Michael Thomas](https://twitter.com/curious_founder/status/1496265065372262404) who shared it on Twitter for the United States.

Data from [Ember](https://ember-climate.org/project/european-electricity-review-2022/#data).
